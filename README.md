# Study Habit Recommendation System

## 📌 Project Overview
The **Study Habit Recommendation System** is a machine learning pipeline designed to analyze student demographics and study behaviors to provide personalized academic habit profiles. By combining **Unsupervised Clustering (K-Means)** with **Supervised Classification (K-Nearest Neighbors)**, the system identifies natural groupings in student data and enables the prediction of habit categories for new users.

## 🚀 Key Features
* **Hybrid Machine Learning Pipeline:** Utilizes K-Means to discover student archetypes and KNN to classify future data points based on discovered clusters.
* **Manual Ordinal Encoding:** Implements a custom encoding strategy to preserve the logical hierarchy of categorical features (e.g., Sleep Hours, Education Level).
* **Dimensionality Reduction:** Leverages **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** to compress 15+ features into a 2D plane for cluster visualization.
* **Heuristic Struggle Scoring:** Features a custom weighted scoring algorithm to qualitatively label clusters based on efficiency and distraction metrics.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python 3.x
* **Data Analysis:** Pandas, NumPy
* **Machine Learning:** Scikit-learn (KMeans, KNeighborsClassifier, PCA, StandardScaler)
* **Visualization:** Matplotlib

## 📊 Methodology

### 1. Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering
Raw survey data is cleaned to remove metadata (Timestamps, Emails). To ensure distance-based algorithms function accurately, categorical data is transformed via **Manual Ordinal Encoding**. This ensures the mathematical distance between "Ineffective" and "Very Effective" is correctly represented.

### 2. Unsupervised Clustering
The data is normalized using StandardScaler and segmented into 4 distinct clusters using **K-Means**. This process identifies natural groupings such as "High Focus" vs. "High Distraction" students.

### 3. Classification & Validation
A **KNN Classifier** is trained using the labels generated by K-Means. The model is validated using a 70/30 train-test split.
* **Performance Metric:** Adjusted Rand Score (ARS)
* **Result:** ~0.62 (indicating strong predictive consistency)

### 4. Qualitative Labeling
Each cluster is assigned a "Struggle Score" based on a weighted average of key performance indicators:

Struggle Score = (0.4 * HabitRating) + (0.3 * DistractionFreq) + (0.2 * ChallengeLevel) + (0.1 * StudyHours)

Based on these scores, clusters are mapped to the following categories:
* 🟢 **Highly Efficient**
* 🔵 **Efficient**
* 🟡 **Moderate**
* 🔴 **Struggling**

## 📈 Visualization
The system utilizes **PCA** to visualize the multi-dimensional student data. The axes represent:
* **Component 1:** Study Efficiency (Variance in sleep, focus methods, and habits)
* **Component 2:** Distraction Level (Variance in extracurriculars and distraction frequency)

## 📥 Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project environment:

1. **Clone the Repository**
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/study-habit-recommendation.git
   cd study-habit-recommendation

2. **Install Dependencies**
   It is recommended to use a virtual environment.
   
   # Create and activate virtual environment
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate

   # Install required packages
   pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib

## 🚀 Execution

1. **Prepare Your Data**
   Ensure you have a file named `responses.csv` in the root directory. The script expects specific categorical headers (Age, Education Level, Hours of Sleep, etc.).

2. **Run the Analysis**
   Execute the Python script to preprocess the data, generate clusters, and view the visualization:
   
   python your_script_name.py

3. **Interpreting Output**
   * **Console:** The script will output the transformed dataframes and the **Adjusted Rand Score**.
   * **Plot:** A scatter plot will display the students color-coded by their study habit quality, with centroids marked to show the "average" student in each category.
